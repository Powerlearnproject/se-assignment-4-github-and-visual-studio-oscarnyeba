Explain the concept of version control in the context of Git. How does GitHub enhance version control for developers?
Branching and Merging in GitHub:

Version Control with Git:
Version control refers to the management of changes to documents, programs, and other information over time. In the context of software development, version control systems (VCS) like Git track modifications to code files, enabling teams to collaborate effectively, manage project history, and revert to previous versions when needed.

Key Concepts of Version Control with Git:
Repository: A repository (repo) is a collection of files and directories managed by Git. It stores all project files and their complete history.

Commits: A commit represents a snapshot of changes to files at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier and includes a message describing the changes made.

Branches: Branches are independent lines of development within a repository. They allow multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes.

Merging: Merging integrates changes from one branch into another. It combines the changes made in the source branch (e.g., feature branch) with the target branch (e.g., main branch).

Pull Requests: Pull Requests (PRs) propose changes from one branch (typically a feature branch) into another branch (often the main branch). They facilitate code review, discussion, and collaboration before merging changes.

How GitHub Enhances Version Control for Developers:

Example: Simple CI/CD Pipeline
Objective: Automate testing and deployment of a Node.js application whenever changes are pushed to the main branch.

Create a Workflow File:
Create a YAML file (e.g., .github/workflows/main.yml) in your repository to define the workflow.

yaml
name: Node.js CI/CD

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '14'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

      - name: Deploy to production
        if: success() && github.event_name == 'push'
        run: |
          echo "Deploying to production server..."
          # Add deployment steps here (e.g., using SSH, deployment scripts)
Explanation of the Workflow:
Name and Trigger: The workflow is named Node.js CI/CD and triggers on push events to the main branch.

Jobs: Defines a single job named build that runs on the latest version of Ubuntu.

Steps:

Checkout code: Checks out the repository code.
Setup Node.js: Sets up Node.js environment using setup-node@v2.
Install dependencies: Installs Node.js dependencies using npm install.
Run tests: Executes tests using npm test.
Deploy to production: Deploys the application to production if tests pass and the event is a push to main.
Workflow Execution:
When code changes are pushed to the main branch, GitHub Actions will automatically trigger the workflow defined in main.yml.
Each step (checkout, setup, install dependencies, test execution, deployment) will be executed sequentially.
If all steps are successful, the deployment step will execute and deploy the application to the production server.
Benefits of GitHub Actions for CI/CD:
Automation: Streamlines development workflows by automating repetitive tasks like testing and deployment.
